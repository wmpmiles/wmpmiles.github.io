## Skyblivion application specifics

I haven't made any mods, but I've spent a fair amount of time in xEdit and the 
CK deconflicting, creating patches, and debugging others mods, though most of
that was for Fallout 4, not Skyrim.

From that I've developed a decent understanding of xEdit scripting, know the 
basics of Papyrus scripting, and know my way around the xEdit and CK interfaces. 
I have a vague understanding of things like the quest/keywords/aliases system.

I also started (though did not get very far) reverse engineering the CK 
because I was frustrated with how unweildy the Precomb/Previs generation system
was.
